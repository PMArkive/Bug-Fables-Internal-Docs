# Musics

A `Musics` is an enum value that represent a song in the game. They are not to be confused with sound effects. Most of them have a corresponding int that tells whether the song is available and bougth at Samira's. The Samira list is saved in the [Save File](../Save%20File.md). 

The musics in the game are located at `Ressources/audio/music` from the game's asset tree.

## Notes about the musics table

Anything marked DOT is named ".", but is either unused or explicitly excluded under normal gameplay.
