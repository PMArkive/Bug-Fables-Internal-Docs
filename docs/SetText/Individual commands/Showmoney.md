# Showmoney

Show the currency count HUD element.

## Syntax

````
|showmoney|
````

## Parameters

None.

## Remarks

Specifically, it sets the timer to show it for 10 frames, but this timer only decreases in [non Dialogue mode](../Dialogue%20mode.md#non-dialogue-mode) while as in [Dialogue mode](../Dialogue%20mode.md), the timer does not decrease. This is based on the [message](../Notable%20states.md#message) lock being in effect.
