# Musics
A `Musics` is an enum value that represent a song in the game. They are not to be confused with sound effects. Most of them have a corresponding int that tells whether the song is available and bougth at Samira's. The Samira list is saved in the [Save File](../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md). 

The musics in the game are located at `Ressources/audio/music` from the game's asset tree.

## Notes about the musics table
Anything the game names `.` is either unused or its name display is explicitly excluded under normal gameplay.
