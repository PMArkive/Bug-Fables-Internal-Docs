# Record entry

A record entry is a collectible bound to a bool that tells whether or not the specific entry for the record has been achieved in the library. Their values are saved in the [Save File](../../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md) and the array of them is located at index 3 of the `MainManager.instance.librarystuff` 2 dimensional jagged array and it contains 256 elements (most are not used as the array is overprosioned in size). On compatible platforms, enabling a record also unlocks its associated achievement.

The entire `librarystuff` two dimensional array is saved on the [Save File](../../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md).
