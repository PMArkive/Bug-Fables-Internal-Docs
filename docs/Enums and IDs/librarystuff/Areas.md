# Areas

An `Areas` enum value represents a group of [Maps](../Maps.md) that belongs to a certain location in the game. Each map must belong to one `Areas` and they are important in determining the scope of any [Regionalflags](../../Flags%20arrays/Regionalflags.md). 

The current area is saved on the [Save File](../../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md).

## Remarks about `librarystuff`

Each area is bound to a bool value stored in a 2 dimensional jagged array located at index 4 of the `MainManager.instance.librarystuff` array that indicates whether or not the area was seen. This allows the game to track which areas to show on the world map. The subarray of `librarystuff` contains 256 elements (most are not used as the array is overprosioned in size). 

The entire `librarystuff` two dimensional array is saved on the [Save File](../../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md).
