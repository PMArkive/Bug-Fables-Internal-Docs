# ActionBehaviors
An `ActionBehaviors` is an enum type that represents a behavior which has some logic to perform on the active main section of Update. It only applies to all [NPCType](NPCType.md) except [Object](Object.md).

There are 2 `ActionBehaviors` defined in [NPCControl data](../../TextAsset%20Data/Entity%20data.md#map-entity-data) with the first one being the default one and the second one being only used when `inrange` is true. Each comes with an `actionfrequency` field that has a different meaning depending on the behavior.

The actual execution of the behavior is done by [DoBehavior](Notable%20methods/DoBehaviour.md) called by [Update](Update.md) which receives the appropriate frequency, but only on the main active section. This means that it is only called when the NPCControl is considered active and a main update occurs (which excludes the special cases of an [Enemy](Enemy.md) when it is dizzy, about to be unfrozen or frozen).

## Enum table
The following is a table of the different enum values (NOT REFERENCED means the game never reference the value meaning it has not logic backing it, UNUSED means the behavior has logic, but it is either dead or not practically used under normal gameplay):
|Value|Name|Summary|
|----:|----|----------|
|0|[None](ActionBehaviors/None.md)|Stops any force move on the entity.|
|1|[FacePlayer](ActionBehaviors/FacePlayer.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and causes the entity to face towards the player if it is present.|
|2|[ChasePlayer](ActionBehaviors/ChasePlayer.md)|Approach the player as close as possible within the `radiuslimit` or until there is no more ground to move in the direction of the player.|
|3|[FleeFromPlayer](ActionBehaviors/FleeFromPlayer.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and have it move towards the opposide direction from the player.|
|4|[TurnRandomly](ActionBehaviors/TurnRandomly.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and periodically causes the entity.`flip` to toggle which turns the entity using a somewhat random time interval.|
|5|[Wander](ActionBehaviors/Wander.md)|Periodically performs a [MoveTowards](../../EntityControl/EntityControl%20Methods.md#movetowards) call after a random amount of time passed on the entity to a random position or the closest possible before unable to move further towards it. The range of movement, maximum time period to wait between wanders and the max distance to move to between wanders are all configurable.|
|6|[FaceAwayFromPlayer](ActionBehaviors/FaceAwayFromPlayer.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and causes the entity.`flip` to be set such that the sprite faces the opposite direction of the player horizontally.|
|7|[TurnFixedInterval](ActionBehaviors/TurnFixedInterval.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and periodically causes the entity.`flip` to toggle which turns the entity using a fixed time interval.|
|8|[Disguise](ActionBehaviors/Disguise.md)|A behavior where the map entity has a special `disguiseobj` that will replace its normal entity.`sprite` appearence until the behavior is switched away from which reveals the entity.`sprite` (usually by going into the `inrange` one). After coming back to this behavior (usually by going out of `inrange`), the entity will move back to its `startpos` and put its disguise on again.|
|9|[DisguiseOnce](ActionBehaviors/DisguiseOnce.md)|The same than [Disguise](Disguise.md), but if it's the default behavior, it becomes [Wander](Wander.md) whenever the player gets `inrange` and the `disguiseobj` is destroyed.|
|10|FollowPlayer|NOT REFERENCED|
|11|[WalkAwayFromPlayer](ActionBehaviors/WalkAwayFromPlayer.md)|UNUSED, This is an alias of [FleeFromPlayer](FleeFromPlayer.md).|
|12|[FaceAhead](ActionBehaviors/FaceAhead.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and causes the entity to face towards the right vector of this entity (towards their x axis facing direction).|
|13|[FaceBehind](ActionBehaviors/FaceBehind.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and causes the entity to face towards the left vector of this entity (the opposite direction of their x axis direction)|
|14|[FaceUp](ActionBehaviors/FaceUp.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and causes the entity to face towards the forward vector of this entity (usually away from the camera).|
|15|[FaceDown](ActionBehaviors/FaceDown.md)|Stops any force move on the entity and causes the entity to face towards the backward vector of this entity (usually towards the camera).|
|16|[SetPath](ActionBehaviors/SetPath.md)|Periodically performs [MoveTowards](../../EntityControl/EntityControl%20Methods.md#movetowards) calls on the entity using a fixed configurable interval between moves and the path being made of position nodes defined in `vectordata`.|
|17|[ChargeAtPlayer](ActionBehaviors/ChargeAtPlayer.md)|Charges at the player with `attacking` set to true during the movement towards the player (this will allow an [Enemy](../NPCType.md#enemy) to initiate a battle with the advantage if it collides with the player and all conditions are met to start a battle with the advantage).|
|18|[ChargeAtPlayerFlipSprite](ActionBehaviors/ChargeAtPlayerFlipSprite.md)|The same then [ChargeAtPlayer](ChargeAtPlayer.md), but right after the [MoveTowards](../../EntityControl/EntityControl%20Methods.md#movetowards) call on the entity, the entity.`sprite` has its angles set to (0.0, the y angles facing the player + 90.0, 0.0) with an `overrideonlyflip` which locks the entity.`sprite` facing direction until the charge part of the coroutine is over.|
|19|[ShootProjectile](ActionBehaviors/ShootProjectile.md)|Attacks the player by shooting an OverworldProjectile which can, under the right conditions, start a battle with advantage. The specifics of the projectile logic is dependant on the [animid](../../../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) and only a few have a logic defined for this behavior.|
|20|[ShootProjectilePredict](ActionBehaviors/ShootProjectilePredict.md)|UNUSED, An alias of [ShootProjectile](ShootProjectile.md).|
|21|[ChargeAndAttack](ActionBehaviors/ChargeAndAttack.md)|The same than [ChasePlayer](ChasePlayer.md), but also attacks the player (with `attacking` set to true during the attack) where the actions depends on the [AnimID](../../../Enums%20and%20IDs/AnimIDs.md) when getting closer than a configurable threshold. Only a few animIds have an attack logic defined for this behavior.|
|22|[AlwaysWander](ActionBehaviors/AlwaysWander.md)|UNUSED, A very cut down version of [wander](Wander.md) where the entity will always, when it can, move somewhere on the next DoBehavior cycle even if it is in the process of moving already.|
|23|[Unmoveable](ActionBehaviors/Unmoveable.md)|Prevents an [Enemy](../NPCType.md#enemy) with this behavior (either default or `inrange`) to not move during the [Dizzy](../Notable%20methods/Dizzy.md) process. This doesn't have any logic, its presence is what affects the NPCControl.|
|24|[ChargeAttackUnderground](ActionBehaviors/ChargeAttackUnderground.md)|The same than [ChargeAndAttack](ChargeAndAttack.md), but the behavior always makes the entity `digging` when not attacking and it can only attack after 30.0 frames of `digtime`.|
|25|[WanderUnderground](ActionBehaviors/WanderUnderground.md)|The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but the entity immediately starts digging underground before actually wandering.|
|26|[StealthAI](ActionBehaviors/StealthAI.md)|Gives the ability of the NPCControl to spot the player if it enters its field of vision (represented by 2 trigger colliders) which has the effect of triggering an [event](../../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Events.md). The event id and the wideness of the field of vision are configurable as well as an option to set the entity.[animstate](../../EntityControl/Animations/animstate.md) to `Sleep` at the start of the DoBehavior cycle.|
|27|[SetPathJump](ActionBehaviors/SetPathJump.md)|Similar than [SetPath](SetPath.md), but after the [MoveTowards](../../EntityControl/EntityControl%20Methods.md#movetowards) call, the entity `forcejump` is set to true which makes it jump during its FixedUpdate when moving to the next node if possible.|
|28|[DisguiseOnceJumpForward](ActionBehaviors/DisguiseOnceJumpForward.md)|UNUSED, A semi functional and likely unfinished behavior similar to [Disguise](Disguise.md) that is recognised as a disguise behavior alongside [Disguise](Disguise.md) and [DisguiseOnce](DisguiseOnce.md), but it doesn't have any DoBehavior logic.|
|29|[ChangeSpriteInRandius](ActionBehaviors/ChangeSpriteInRandius.md)|When the player is present, the entity.[animstate](../../EntityControl/Animations/animstate.md) is set to `actionfrequency[0]` when the distance between this and the player is less than the `wanderradius`, it is set to `actionfrequency[1]` otherwise.|
|30|[ChaseWhenAnim](ActionBehaviors/ChaseWhenAnim.md)|Perform the same logic than [ChasePlayer](ChasePlayer.md) when the entity.[animstate](../../EntityControl/Animations/animstate.md) is `Chase`. Otherwise, if the entity.`animstate` isn't the frequency, entity.`animstate` is set to it with a 20.0 frames `behaviorcooldown` (prevents a [WalkWhenAnim](WalkWhenAnim.md) doing a [Wander](Wander.md) DoBehavior cycle to process for 20.0 frames when entity.`animstate` is `Idle`) and a [StopForceMove](../../EntityControl/EntityControl%20Methods.md) call on the entity.|
|31|[WalkWhenAnim](ActionBehaviors/WalkWhenAnim.md)|Perform [Wander](Wander.md) when the entity [animstate](../../EntityControl/Animations/animstate.md) is `Walk` (or `Idle` if the `behaviorcooldown` expired) or change it to the frequency when it's not with a `behaviorcooldown` of 20.0 frames (prevents another [Wander](Wander.md) cycle to process for 20.0 frames when entity.`animstate` is `Idle`).|
|32|[WanderOffscreen](ActionBehaviors/WanderOffscreen.md)|The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but movements are allowed when inactive or paused.|
|33|[WanderNoWarp](ActionBehaviors/WanderNoWarp.md)|The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but the warp branch logic is disabled. This means even if `maxtries` reaches 20 or that the distance between this position and the entity.`startpos` gets higher than `radiuslimit`, the entity will not warp and continue as normal.|
|34|[WanderOnWater](ActionBehaviors/WanderOnWater.md)|The same than [WanderNoWarp](WanderNoWarp.md), but the y position is adjusted according to the map.`waterfloat` if one exists.|
|35|[ChaseOnWater](ActionBehaviors/ChaseOnWater.md)|The same than [ChasePlayer](ChasePlayer.md), but the y position is adjusted according to the map.`waterfloat` if one exists.|
