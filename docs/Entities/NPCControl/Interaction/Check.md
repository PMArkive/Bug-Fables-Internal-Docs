# Check
An alias of [Talk](Talk.md), but the emoticon the NPC gets is the blue ? one when it is in the `npc` list of the player.

## args meaning
None.

## Interact
The same then [Talk](Talk.md)

## PlayerControl.LateUpdate
The same then [Talk](Talk.md), but the entity.`emoticonid` is 1 (a blue ?) instead of 0.
