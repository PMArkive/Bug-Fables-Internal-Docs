# ResetCamera
A zone where the camera is reset to default via MainManager.ResetCamera when the player enters it.

## Data Arrays
None.

## Setup
A few adjustements occurs:
- The entity.`alwaysactive` is set to true
- The gameObject's isStatic is set to true
- The entity.`rigid` is placed in kinematic mode without gravity
- `nointeract` is set to true
- The layer is set to 0 (default)
- The `scol` is disabled

## Update
If the `timer` hasn't expired yet, it is decremented by the game's frametime clamped from 0.0 to infinity. Otherwise, if it is 0.0 and the entity isn't `dead`, a [Death](../../EntityControl/Notable%20methods/Death.md) coroutine is started with the entity.

## OnTriggerEnter if the other collider is the player
The camera values are reset to their defaults via MainManager's ResetCamera.
