# DisguiseOnceJumpForward
A semi functional and likely unfinished behavior similar to [Disguise](Disguise.md) that is recognised as a disguise behavior alongside [Disguise](Disguise.md) and [DisguiseOnce](DisguiseOnce.md), but it doesn't have any DoBehavior logic.

> NOTE: this is unused under normal gameplay and is likely not fully functional despite having unique logic backing this behavior (in this case, not doing anything in DoBehavior).
