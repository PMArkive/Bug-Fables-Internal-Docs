# WanderNoWarp
The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but the warp branch logic is disabled. This means even if `maxtries` reaches 20 or that the distance between this position and the entity `startpos` gets higher than `radiuslimit`, the entity will not warp and continue as normal.

## Frequency meaning
The same than [Wander](Wander.md)

## DoBehavior
The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but the warp branch in the logic is disabled.
