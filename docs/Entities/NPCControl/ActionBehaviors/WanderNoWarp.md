# WanderNoWarp
The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but the warp branch logic is disabled. This means even if `maxtries` reaches 20 or that the distance between this position and the entity.`startpos` gets higher than `radiuslimit`, the entity will not warp and continue as normal.

## Frequency meaning
The same than [Wander](Wander.md).

## Additional data
The same than [Wander](Wander.md).

## SetUp (Only if it's the default behavior)
There is no logic here unlike [Wander](Wander.md).

## DoBehavior
The same than [Wander](Wander.md), but the warp branch in the logic is disabled.
