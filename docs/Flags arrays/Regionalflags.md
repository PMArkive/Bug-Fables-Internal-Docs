# Regionalflags

A `regionalflag` is a bool which is a variable the game can access globally while its value is kept until an [area](../SetText/Individual%20commands/Area.md) change occurs in the game or until a reset is specifically requested by the game. When a reset occurs, all regionalflag are set to false. They are saved on the [Save File](../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md) and are used to track temporary progress in an area such as defeating an enemy in the overworld. There are 100 regional flags available in the `MainManager.instance.regionalflags` array.

## Notes about the regionalflags tables

Since the meaning of the regional flags depends on the [Areas](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Areas.md), there will be one table per area in this document.

The instances in which the game specifically requests a reset will be mentioned in the table of the concerned area.

When an enemy is mentioned (which is most of the regional flags),
it is implied the value gets set to `true` when being defeated unless specified otherwise.

Any ID not specified implies UNUSED.
