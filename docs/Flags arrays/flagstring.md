# Flagstring

A `flagstring` is a string which is a global variable the game can access for any purpose. They are saved on the [Save File](../External%20data%20format/Save%20File.md) and typically have one reserved use, but some can be used temporarily notably in [SetText](../SetText/SetText.md) operations. There are 15 flagstrings available to the game in the `MainManager.instance.flagstring` array.

## Notes about the flagstrings table

A flagstring with the mention "TEMP" means its value in the save is meaningless since it is only used for temporary usage by the game.

The format is the following: comma separated list of the items ID (refer to Appendix C) followed by a "-", followed by the same list for key items, followed by a "-" followed by the berry count.

Each element's index in the list (starting at 0) contains the information about a worm type for the fishing minigame (meaning under normal gameplay, this should always have 10 elements). For each element, the first float is the amount of worms caught of the matching type (it MUST be parsable as an integer) and the second float is the largest size in cm caught of the matching type|
