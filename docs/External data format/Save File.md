# Bug Fables Save Format

A save file in Bug Fables is a XOR encrypted regular text file. It is a very simple
symmetric encryption scheme where each bytes is XORed with a number called the key.
This key is present in the TextAsset located at `Ressources/Data/Key` in the asset tree.

The operation to encrypt or decrypt are identical.

The file is composed of exactly 18 lines. There are 3 types of line format:

* Fields line: contain fields of various meaning, separated by ",".
* List line: contain a list of items, separated by "," unless specified otherwise.
* Array line: contain an array, each element is separated by "@" and each element is either a list or fields.

## Format differences between 1.0.x and 1.1.x

There were 2 changes done to the format in the 1.1.0 version of the game. Specifically, the amount of items in the [flagvar](../Flags%20arrays/flagvar.md) and [flags](../Flags%20arrays/flags.md) line have increased. When a 1.0.x save file is loaded into the game, it will load normally, but with the new items getting a default value (in this case, false). The game uses a specific flag to determine if the file is in 1.0.x format or 1.1.x format. If it detects it's a 1.0.5 file, it will perform some directives to adapt it as some logic changes and flags changes impacted it. Once it is done, it will set the flag checked earlier to true which will prevent the game from performing the conversion twice. This works because this flag slot is not used in 1.0.x so it will never be true until the conversion is done in 1.1.x. This will only persist once a save in the game is performed at which point, the save file is permanently converted to a 1.1.x format.

If a party member is not present, its element is empty.

An array element contains the following fields:

and for Shade's shop, it's the first 2. An empty slot means there will be no medals
