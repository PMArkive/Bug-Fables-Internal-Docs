# GetRandomAvaliablePlayer
This method obtains a suitable player party member index using the regular targetting rules.

```cs
private int GetRandomAvaliablePlayer(bool nullable)
```

## Parameters

- `nullable`: ??? There is an overload without this that behaves the same as if false was sent

## Procedure
The logic depends on nullable's value

### nullable is true
If `forceattack` isn't -1, it is returned.

Otherwise, there will be attempts to find a random player party member to target. Each attempt involves generating a random one using uniformly random probabilities between each of them. For the target to be accepted, its `hp` must be above 0. The amount of times this is attempted is the amount of player party members. If a target is accepted it is returned, otherwise, -1 is returned.

TODO: This targetting scheme seems broken compared to the other one

## nullable is false
If `forceattack` isn't -1 and the player party member corresponding to it doens't have an `eatenby`, it is returned.

Otherwise, there is an infinite loop that starts:

- A random `partypointer` element (a `playerdata` index) is generated by generating a number from -2 (inclusive) to the amount of player party members (exclusive) clamped from 0 to the amount of player party members (this essentially biases to target the first party member more)
- If the player party member's `hp` is 0 or its `eatenby` exists, the target is rejected and the loop restarts
- Otherwise, if the player party member has the `LeafCloak` [medal](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Medal.md) equipped, the target is rejected, but this can only happen once: if another target passes the `hp` and `eatenby` checks, it is automatically accepted and returned
- Otherwise, the target is accepted and returned

The overall targetting odds are as follows:

|Amount of player party members|Who has `LeafCloak`?|Odds front|Odds second|Odds third|
|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|
|2|No one|3/4|1/4|N/A|
|2|Front|9/16|7/16|N/A|
|2|Second|15/16|1/16|N/A|
|3|No one|3/5|1/5|1/5|
|3|Front|9/25|8/25|8/25|
|3|Second|18/25|1/25|6/25|
|3|Third|18/25|6/25|1/25|
