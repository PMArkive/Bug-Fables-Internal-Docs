# Records data

[Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md) data are split in 2 TextAssets in the game loaded on boot by SetVariables: 

* `Ressources/data/SynopsisOrder`
* `Synopsis` from the corresponding dialogue directory of the current [languageid](../SetText/languageid.md)

## `SynopsisOrder` data

The asset contains one line per [Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md) which contains the ordered list of the entries shown in game where each entry is one line. Each line contains 2 fields separated by `,`:

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|Id|[Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md) id|The id this line refers to|
|Icon|int|Index of the sprite in `Sprites/Items/EnemyPortraits`|

The id is loaded into `libraryorder[3, id]`  and the icon is loaded into `achiveicons[id]` where `id` is the [Discoveries entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Discoveries%20entry.md) id.

The ordering is managed by PauseMenu and the [Library List Type](../ItemList/List%20Types%20Group%20Details/Library%20List%20Type.md).

## `Synopsis` data

The asset contains one line per [Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md) whose id corresponds to the line index. Each line contains 2 fields separated by `@`:

|Loaded index|Name|Type|Description|
|------------|----|----|-----------|
|0|Name|[SetText](../SetText/SetText.md) string|The name of the [Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md)|
|1|Description|[SetText](../SetText/SetText.md) string|The description of the [Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md)|

The data will be loaded into `librarydata[2, id, x]` where `id` is the [Records entry](../Enums%20and%20IDs/librarystuff/Records%20entry.md) id and `x` is the loaded index.

The name of the entry is handled by the [Library List Type](../ItemList/List%20Types%20Group%20Details/Library%20List%20Type.md) while the description is only rendered underneath the icon in the PauseMenu.
