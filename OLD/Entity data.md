# Entity data

An entity in Bug Fables is a game object that is dynamically loaded into the game and has specific behaviors. Most entities are specified in files called entity data files which belongs to a specific map. There are many kinds of entities in the game, but they always use the same system format no matter what type it is making it a very global and monolithic system. The logic in the system is defined in the `EntityControl` and `NPCControl` components.

## Entity Data File

Each line of an entity map file contains one line per entity. It contains fields about its `EntityControl` and its `NPCControl` separated by `}`. Each file corresponds to each map in the game where its filename is the [Maps](../Enums%20and%20IDs/Maps.md)'s name.

The names of each entity are not contained in the data files. They are contained in a `names` folder next to the data files. An entity name file contains one string per line that corresponds to the name of entity of the matching line in the matching data file.

Path to the entity data files from the asset tree: `Resources/data/entitydata`
Path to the entity name files from the asset tree: `Resources/data/entitydata/names`

The name of an entity can contain special strings to act as modifiers on it.

An entity, when created, will have the game make the following hierarchy a the root of the main Scene:

* Entity (name in entity name file, has an `EntityControl` and a `CapsuleCollider`)
  * Rotater
    * Sprite (has a `SpriteRenderer`)
  * MoveRotater

The `SpriteRenderer` component of the Sprite GameObject is accessible via the `sprite` field.
The `MoveRotater` GameObject is accessible via the `movetotater` field.
The `CapsuleCollider` component of the entity GameObject is accessible via the `ccol` field.

## Name Modifiers

It is possible to combine them by containing multiple of modifiers. Here are all the possible ones:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Holo|Sets hologram to true on Start. This renders the entity as a hologram|
|ICE|Sets npcdata.extrafreeze to true on Start. This forces the effect of Extra Freeze to apply. It only works on NPCType.Enemy|
|TIME|Sets extratimer to true on Start. This gives twice as much time for the entity to move to its target before triggering the failsafe|
|COT|Cave Of Trails; On Start, sets hologram to true. This renders the entity as a hologram|
|Fixed|On Start, sets fixedentity to true. This freezes all constraints on the rigid body Invokes SetFixed. This forces the entity to be completly fixed in position, no gravity or physics influence and disables the ccol (can be undone by calling Unfix)|
|FxdCol|On Start, sets fixedentity to true. This freezes all constraints on the rigid body Invokes SetFixedCollider. This forces the entity to be completly fixed in position, no gravity or physics influence WITHOUT disabling the ccol (can be undone by calling Unfix)|
|ALW|Always; Sets alwaysactive to true. This forces the entity to be seen as in the camera range and will always be active on Update|
|PAU|Pause; Sets activeonpause to true. This allows the entity to be active on Update even when paused or in a message|
|HIDE|Sets hideinside to true. This causes the GameObject to be disabled when inside|
|ROT|Rotater; Sets lockrotater to true. This prevents the rotater from updating its angle. Also causes the angle to be set in 0.25 seconds on create|
|ShwEm|Show Emotions; Sets alwaysemotions to true. This allows to see the emotes??? (TODO) of the entity regardless of distance to player|
|COG|Does a Raycast downward and sets startpos to the hitinfo.point??? (TODO)|
|NGS|No Ground Start; sets onground to false on Start|
|ITHD|Interact Horn Dash; Calls SetHitInteract with NPCControl.HitInteract.HornDash|
|NEAR|Alows CheckNear to destroy GameObjects who are 30f away from the player's z position|
|WTA|Water; Adds water effects when Kabbu horns an upstanding bridge|
|TOG|Toggke; Adds hit toggling features (like the toggle switches in the Power Plant puzzle)|
|NGF|No Gravity Fix; GravityFix will not run on Start, only applicable for NPCType.Enemy|
|NDTCT|No Detector; The detector medal will not beep from this entity|
|DDIST|Detector Distance; The Detector medal will only beep from this entity if it is closer than 20.0 from the player's z position|

## NPC Types

The type will be the tag of the entity GameObject except for `SemiNPC` which 
will be `NPC`. Here are the different `NPCType`:

### NPC

It has the most unique behaviors out of every types. It generally acts as a full NPC
that can be talked to, have emotes and has a pusher. 
Shares some behaviors with `SemiNPC` and `Enemy`.

Shared with `SemiNPC`

* Can be interacted with the jump button
* Can have special emotes when close by??? (TODO)

Shared with `Enemy`

* Can get affected by `FixEntities`
* Will stop force move when inactive every 3 frames if force move?
* Can be Unfixed without force
* It will have its `scol` disabled

### SemiNPC

It is recognised as if it was the same as an `NPC` in Setup, but only has a very limited
set of behaviors shared with `NPC`. It has no exclusive behaviors so it's basically a limited
`NPC` type.

Shared with `NPC`

* Can be interacted with the jump button
* Can have special emotes when close by??? (TODO)

### Enemy

This type is specifically made for special enemies behavior such as the ability to go into battle.
It shares some behaviors with `NPC`.

* Will get `GravityFix` on Start

* Has lost and found behaviors with the player
* Its mass is 10 times less than other types
* The entity has a `CapsuleCollider` called `secondcoll` that is trigger
* Has custom freeze behavior on `Update` and `OnTriggerEnter`
* Has custom behaviors on Update that manages battling and being dizzy
* Has custom respawn behavior on `LateUpdate`
* The `digpart` has a different `RenderQueue`? (TODO)
* Custom `Death` behavior
* Custom hazard stuff??? (TODO)

Shared with `NPC`

* Can get affected by `FixEntities`
* Will stop force move when inactive every 3 frames if force move? (TODO)
* Can be Unfixed without force
* It will have its scol disabled

### Object

Almost has no specific behaviors. It doesn't share any and only has its own logic.
Most of the details of the logic are defined in the `ObjectTypes`.

* Has `OnTriggerExit` and `OnTriggerStay` behaviors
* It will have its `ccoll` disabled on `Start`

## Ojbject Types

## Action Behaviors

Here are the different `ActionBehaviors`:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|None|Nothing, only does a `StopForceMove`.|
|FacePlayer|Faces towards the player. Will also face towards the player when interacting|
|ChasePlayer|Basic chase player behavior; the entity will move towards the player with an emote. If paused or inevent, `StopForceMove` is called|
|FleeFromPlayer|Move away from the player if not tattling or paused?|
|TurnRandomly|Flip and set the `actioncooldown` to a random amount of frames between half of the frequency and double the frequency. The first `actioncooldown` is `actionfrequency[0]`|
|Wander|Basic wandering behavior; The entity will attempt to move to a random position in the radiuslimit up to 50 times and `actioncooldown` is then set to a random range between the third of the frequency and the frequency itself|
|FaceAwayFromPlayer|Flip to the opposite direction of the x position of the player|
|TurnFixedInterval|Same as `TurnRandomly`, but the `actioncooldown` is always the frequency itself|
|Disguise|Basic diguise behavior; The entity will not appear as is and will instead appear as its disguise obj until the player gets in range. After that, the entity will go back to its startpos and put back the disguise after 120 frames (flips each 40 frames)|
|DisguiseOnce|Same as disguise, but the behavior becomes Wander after the player is inrange|
|FollowPlayer|UNUSED|
|WalkAwayFromPlayer|UNUSED, Same as FleeFromPlayer|
|FaceAhead|Face to the right|
|FaceBehind|Face to the left|
|FaceUp|Face forward (+z)|
|FaceDown|Face backward (-z)|
|SetPath|Is `alwaysactive` on setup; The entity will follow a path on loop made up by the vectors in vectordata|
|ChargeAtPlayer|The entity will move towards the player while attacking (similar to ChasePlayer, but with custom behavior)|
|ChargeAtPlayerFlipSprite|Same as ChargeAtPlayer, but the sprite will flip towards the player?|
|ShootProjectile|The entity will shoot an OverworldProjectile?|
|ShootProjectilePredict|UNUSED, Same as ShootProjectile|
|ChargeAndAttack|Same as `ChasePlayer`, but will also attack while chasing (diff with `ChargeAtPlayer`???) TODO|
|AlwaysWander|Same as Wander, but there is no cooldown between the wandering at the points|
|Unmoveable|The entity cannot be launched upwards when getting dizzy|
|ChargeAttackUnderground|Same as `ChargeAndAttack`, but the entity is digging and can `ChargeAndAttack` if it has been digging for 30 fames|
|WanderUnderground|Same as Wander, but the entity is digging|
|StealthAI|The entity will have a `StealthCheck` component, be alwaysactive and have extratimer on Setup.
