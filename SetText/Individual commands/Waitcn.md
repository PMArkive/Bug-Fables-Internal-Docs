# Waitcn

Yield until the chapter intro coroutine is over.

## Syntax

````
|waitcn|
````

## Parameters

None.

## Remarks

While this coroutine is typically used for actually playing chapter introductions in [Events](../../Enums%20and%20IDs/Events.md) and in [chapterintro](Chapterintro.md), there are other usages of this coroutine that will affect this command. The other ones are [innsleep](Innsleep.md) and LoadEverything (which occurs on boot).

This command is unused under normal gameplay.
