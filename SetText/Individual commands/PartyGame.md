# PartyGame

This command will cause an exception to be thrown (see remarks for more details), do not use. 

## Syntax

````
|partygame|
````

## Parameters

None.

## Remarks

This command was intended to start a third minigame similarly to how [beeGame](BeeGame.md) and [dungeongame](DungeonGame.md) operates. However, this minigame ended up being scrapped earlier in development and this command as well as a few unused assets remained as relics from it.

It is technically a valid command and it will process and attempt to start a minigame in a similar manner to the other 2, but because no object is assigned to the game, SetText will throw.

This command is unused under normal gameplay.
