# Tab

Set the tabsize of the current letter slot in [Single Letter Rendering](../Letter%20Rendering%20Methods/Single%20Letter%20Rendering.md)

## Syntax

````
|tab,tabsize|
````

## Parameters

### `tabsize`: int

The amount of spaces a `\t` character corresponds to. This must be a valid int or an exception will be thrown.

## Remarks

This command while functional doesn't do anything practical in [Regular Letter Rendering](../Letter%20Rendering%20Methods/Regular%20Letter%20Rendering.md) because it only affects the letter slot used in [Single Letter Rendering](../Letter%20Rendering%20Methods/Single%20Letter%20Rendering.md).
