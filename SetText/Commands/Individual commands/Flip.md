# Flip

Toggle or set the flip state of an [Entity](../../../Entities/Entity.md) or the party.

## Syntax

(1)

````
|flip,party|
````

(2)

````
|flip,party,newflip|
````

(3)

````
|flip,entity|
````

(4)

````
|flip,entity,newflip|
````

## Parameters

### `party`

This value indicates to operate with syntax (1) / (2) and will have each party [Entity](../../../Entities/Entity.md)'s flip state be affected. Any other value will be interpreted as `entity`.

### `entity`: int | string

The [Entity](../../../Entities/Entity.md) to set its flip state. The int form is a regular [Entity id](../Entity%20id.md) and its restriction for valid values applies. The string is only applicable if caller isn't null and it will be interpreted as the int form otherwise. This form can be one of the following:

* `this`: Refers to the [tailtarget](../../Notable%20local%20variable/tailtarget.md). This must not be null or an exception will be thrown.
* `caller`: Refers to the caller. This must not be null or an exception will be thrown.
* Anything else: if the string is in the [Define](Define.md) list, it will refer to it. Otherwise, the value will be interpreted as the int form.

### `newflip`: `true` | `false`

The new flip state to set `entity` or the party. Any other value than `true` or `false` will throw an exception.

## Remarks

Syntax (1) and (3) toggles the flip state while (2) and (4) sets it to a specific one.
